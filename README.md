## Problem
Enable organizations to verify health credentials for employees, students, customers, and visitors entering their site based on criteria specified by the organization. Privacy and integrity is central to the solution, and the digital wallet can allow individuals to maintain control of their personal health information and share it in a way that is secured, verifiable, and trusted. Participants can attempt to model processes to implement contact-tracing using digital health passports, to identify other individuals who accessed the same spaces/areas in a set period.
